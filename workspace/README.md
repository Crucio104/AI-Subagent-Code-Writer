# Merge Sort Implementation in Python

This repository contains a clean, efficient, and well-structured implementation of the **Merge Sort** algorithm in Python.

## Features

- **Pure Python**: No external dependencies required.
- **Stable Sort**: Equal elements maintain their relative order.
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) in all cases.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) — due to temporary arrays used during merging.
- **Tested**: Includes a comprehensive test suite.

## Usage

1. Save all files in a directory.
2. Run `python main.py` to test the algorithm.
3. Run `python -m tests.test_merge_sort` to run tests.
